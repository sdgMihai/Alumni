This is my project of an web application that facilitates the communcation of parents, structured as a chat.

## Technologies - Languages+Frameworks ##
*Java 8 / Spring + Junit 5* - for this backend.  
*Typescript / Angular 9*  - frontend - the socketio compat. version is dependent on the framework version used).  
*SocketIO* - netty version -> 1.7.17
Check the compatible version on the frontend repo for JavaScript.

It worked on localhost!
The project works on docker with a slightly different configuration.
